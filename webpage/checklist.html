        This checklist is organized into two main categories:
    </p>

    <div class="intro-block">
        <p><strong>System concerns:</strong> Address quality attribute concerns that apply to the system as a whole, without requiring special considerations for ML components compared to traditional components.</p>
        <p><strong>Process concerns:</strong> Focus on the effective management and execution of the development and maintenance process for ML-enabled systems, as well as concerns specific to architecting such systems.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="intro-text">
        Each check in the checklist is described using the following fields:
    </p>

    <div class="intro-block">
        <p><strong>ID:</strong> A unique identifier following a naming convention: the capital initial of the main category (S for System, P for Process) followed by the capital initial of the subcategory (e.g., A for Availability) and an integer. If ambiguities arise, a two-letter abbreviation is used (e.g., SMD for System–Modularity).</p>
        <p><strong>Name:</strong> A brief descriptive label summarizing the focus of the check.</p>
        <p><strong>Source:</strong> The origin of the check, as derived from prior research and empirical studies.</p>
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> Additional contextual information supporting the check’s relevance.</p>
        <p><strong>Check:</strong> The specific question or statement to be considered during architectural decision-making.</p>
        <p><strong>ML Specificity:</strong> The degree to which the check is specific to ML-intensive systems, categorized as low (L), medium (M), or high (H).</p>
